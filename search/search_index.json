Use this cumulative knowledge and processes outlined in the following pages to drive alignment and consensus in your organization by taking the first steps toward a more secure, compliant posture for your organization in the cloud. </p> <p>Each of the sections in this guide can be leveraged as standalone guidance, or all together to define your overall compliance strategy. Many of the solutions covered in this guide will require participation from various teams and business groups within your organization. Customers who achieve successful roll outs of the capabilities typically prioritize by a use case scenario and create a working virtual team to manage the requirements validation, proof of concept testing in a pre-production environment, internal checkpoints, and approvals and finally deployment into the production environment. We recommend identifying your top 1-2 scenarios for deployment and tackling those first, with the right resources from your broader team engaged. Once those priorities are deployed, come back to this guide to identify the next two priorities for deployment and repeat the process of stakeholder alignment, testing and validation on the path to successful deployment. </p> <p>We believe our solutions from Microsoft 365 are the best of suite to help our customers know their data better, by protecting and governing data throughout its lifecycle in a heterogenous environment.

It defines how you assess and manage system configuration, organizational process, and people responsible for meeting a specific requirement of a regulation, standard, or policy. <ul> <li>Compliance Manager tracks the following types of controls:  <ul> <li>Microsoft managed controls: controls for Microsoft cloud services, which Microsoft is responsible for implementing. </li> <li>Your controls: sometimes referred to as customer managed controls, these are controls implemented and managed by your organization. </li> <li>Shared Controls: sometimes referred to as customer managed controls, these are controls implemented and managed by your organization.  <ul> <li>Compliance Manager automatically scans through your Microsoft 365 environment and detects your system settings, continuously and automatically updating your technical action status.

You can configure groups in whatever way is most logical for your organization. For example, you may group assessments by audit year, region, solution, teams within your organization, or some other way. Once you create groups, you can filter your Compliance Manager dashboard to view your score by one or more groups. It is important to note that the same action, if tenant scoped, can be in multiple groups. If this is the case, the action can be updated in one of the groups and it would be replicated to all groups that contain that action. For example, take MFA being required on Admin accounts.

When you create an assessment, you\u2019ll need to assign it to a group during the process. This is an important step to plan out before you create assessments. Groups are containers that you can use to organize your assessments that are logical to you. Some examples might be by year, regulation, department, or geographies.  </p> <p>An example of this might be:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Assessments 2020</p> <ul> <li>FFIEC IS</li> <li>GDPR</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>US 2020</p> <ul> <li>FFIEC IS</li> <li>FISMA</li> <li>United States of America Privacy Act</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ohio 2021</p> <ul> <li>Ohio Data Protection Act 2018</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>EU 2020</p> <ul> <li>GDPR</li> <li>Directive 2006/24/EC</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>It is important to understand how improvement actions work within a group and across groups. When two different assessments in the same group share improvement actions that are managed by you, any updates you make to an action's implementation details or status will automatically synchronize to the same action in any other assessment in the group. This synchronization allows you to implement one improvement action and meet several requirements across multiple regulations. If the improvement action is a tenant action, for example require MFA, there will only be one action for all groups. So, completing this in one group will apply the same status to all groups that have this action.  </p> <p>While working within a group you can see all the actions for that group and a breakdown of the score for the group you are working on. While you can always see the score for the tenant, it is sometimes easier to focus in on a particular group.  </p>"},{"location":"dag/cm/#what-to-know-when-working-with-groups","title":"What to know when working with groups","text":"<p>There are some additional guidelines when working with groups that you should be aware of.  </p> <ul> <li>Group names must be unique within your organization.

When you extend an out of the box assessment template, it will continue to receive any updates released by Microsoft, which may happen when there are changes to the related regulation or product.  </p> <p>The nice benefit of this is you can customize what we have given to you as a template to meet your organizational needs or expand to assess your 3rd party platforms.

These technologies include Office Message Encryption, Azure Rights Management, and sensitivity labels. If a file that is encrypted with a Microsoft encryption technology is attached to an email message or located on a SharePoint or OneDrive account, those encrypted items are decrypted when the search results are prepared for preview, added to a review set in Advanced eDiscovery, and exported. Should you need to further investigate messages identified by your communication compliance policy, you can use the Escalate for Investigation control to create a new Advanced eDiscovery case. You will provide a name and notes for the new case, and user who sent the message matching the policy is automatically assigned as the case custodian. </p> <p>Things to note for both Insider Risk Management and Communication Compliance integration with Advanced eDiscovery: - The underlying content of the escalation from IRM/CC is automatically added to a review set in the case in Advanced eDiscovery. You can put data sources on hold or run further searches on the custodians and locations that you deem relevant and add results as per relevance to the same or different review sets. - For the IRM or CC admin to have visibility to the case in Advanced eDiscovery, it is essential for them to have the eDiscovery Manager/Administrator privilege.</p> </li> <li> <p>With information in many locations organization need an easy way to be able to audit then activities across many different services in Microsoft 365.

Pre-defined and custom policies allow you to scan internal and external communications for policy matches so they can be examined by designated reviewers.</p> <p>Reviewers can investigate communications in your organization that do not meet your standards, as identified through configurable rules, and take appropriate remediation actions to make sure that they are compliant with your organization's message standards. Communication compliance supports several company communications channels including those part of the Microsoft 365 solution such as Exchange email, Microsoft Teams, Yammer or Skype for Business, as well as a large number of third-party communication platforms integrated through available connectors such as Twitter, Facebook, and Bloomberg instant messages. More details on third-party connectors can be found here.</p> <p>Communication compliance policies in Microsoft 365 help you overcome many modern challenges associated with compliance and internal and external communications, including:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scanning increasing numbers of communication channels</p> </li> <li> <p>The increasing communication volumes</p> </li> <li> <p>Regulatory enforcement &amp; the risk of fines</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dag/ir-cc/#best-practices","title":"Best Practices","text":"<p>Let\u2019s establish some of the preparation that goes into start of execution of using communication compliance to help plan your deployment.</p>"},{"location":"dag/ir-cc/#policy-definition","title":"Policy Definition","text":"<p>While the usage of communication compliance is distinct to each organization and their business and regulatory requirements and the policies you define will need to be designed accordingly, the following criteria can be used to guide the initial creation of policies at most organizations.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Decide whether your organization\u2019s use cases for the solution revolve around regulatory compliance, enforcing a code of conduct, preventing self-harm or harm to others, or monitoring external communications by specific employees (or more than one of these or other scenarios), and define policies based on this decision according to the following rules. </p> </li> <li> <p>For code of conduct policies: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is generally advised that you create policies that cover all employees. While code of conduct violations by employees in some roles may be more problematic than in other roles, a minimum set of rules must be met by all employees, so start with a single policy that is scoped to all employees. </p> </li> <li> <p>Code of conduct policies typically utilize the built-in classifiers for offensive language. Create a policy utilizing the classifiers for profanity, harassment, targeted harassment, adult images, gory images, and racy images (it is alternatively possible to create separate policies for some of these if you think they should be monitored by different auditors or the response time needed for different types of offenses may vary significantly). While it is possible to create your own trainable classifiers for handling specific offensive or non-compliant terms, it is generally easier to start with the built-in classifiers and only train or retrain your own classifiers if needed. </p> </li> <li> <p>In some organizations, it may not be necessary to detect all offenses, and configuring the policy to only create alerts to a given percentage of offensive language use may be effective enough, since if employees know their communications are being regularly monitoring that may be enough incentive for them to follow the rules. In other organizations where no exceptions can be allowed a 100% review percentage may be needed. </p> </li> <li> <p>It is possible to create overlapping rules for specific roles such as executives, people working with customers or people in special, external-facing roles, or policies targeting specific communication channels that can have higher exposure such as social media. Such roles can be more aggressive in their rules and have higher review percentages than rules for the general population. </p> </li> <li> <p>In most cases, for code of conduct policies you will want to monitor both internal and outbound communications. Monitoring inbound communications can also be useful for detecting potential sources of stress to your employees.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>For policies related to monitoring self-harm or threats to others, similar practices to the ones for offensive language apply, but it is generally advised to create a policy that is separate from offensive language, since this type of policy usually requires a quicker reaction time in order to avoid actual harm and you may want to monitor such alerts more diligently. You will also likely want to configure a 100% review for such policies. </p> </li> <li> <p>For meeting regulatory compliance requirements, you will typically create a custom policy with rules that are dictated by your regulatory requirements. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Typically, you will create a policy starting with the regulatory compliance policy template and configure it with rules that utilize \u201cmessage (or attachment) contains any of these words\u201d and provide words or phrases frequently used in language that represents the type of risks you want to identify. For example, for detecting situations such as improper gifts you can define phrases like \u201ccomplimentary\u201d, \u201cgift\u201d, \u201cat no cost to you\u201d and \u201cour treat\u201d. </p> </li> <li> <p>For more complex requirements, you can create custom Sensitive Information Types (SIT) and use them in your policies. A custom SIT can use large dictionaries that are easier to maintain, combinations of different lists of words, complex conditions including operators (and/or/not) and near relationships between terms and more.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Go to Data Classification page in M365 SCC, navigate to Sensitive Info Types tab. Click Create Info Type and use your dictionary to create a custom SIT. For more details, check this How to setup a keyword dictionary</p> </li> <li> <p>Go to Policies tab in Communication Compliance admin portal and click Create Policy. Choose Custom Policy from the drop-down menu and use custom create SIT in the Conditions And Percentages page of the New Policy Wizard along with other details as required.</p> </li> <li> <p>This method can require more effort to implement than a simple keyword list or a trainable classifier, so it is recommended that you start with the simpler option and assess your accuracy before committing to more complex policies based on sensitive info types.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In most cases, regulatory compliance policies can be scoped to specific communications, in particular including only external communications or communications to/from specific organizations can significantly reduce the volume of alerts to review while keeping the relevant messages in scope. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Communication compliance can also be used for monitoring communications through official channels (such as official communications by executives and PR people such as on Twitter feeds). While it is rare that an employee would intentionally commit policy violations in such channels, it is not as rare that an employee mixes up their personal account with the official one and send improper messages that way. Using Communication compliance to monitor such media can help rapidly detect potential offenses and delete the offending messages. In most cases you may want to utilize the built-in classifiers for offensive language, harassment, and the classifiers for gory, racy and adult images for these policies. </p> </li> <li> <p>If your organization is multi-national or have employees that communicate in multiple languages, contact Microsoft for access to the Offensive Language classifiers in different languages, currently in preview. If you do so, unless you know that all your auditors are fluent in all the languages in question, it is often recommended that you create separate policies for each of these languages, so you can assign in each policy reviewers that can read the language in question and properly assess the offenses. </p> <ul> <li>Since Communication compliance will attempt to detect the language in which a message is written and will use the right classifiers accordingly, it is generally not required to assign policies in specific languages to known speakers of those languages. Still, doing so can reduce false positives due to the fact that certain non-offensive words in some languages can be identical to offensive words in other languages, so if you have large known populations that communicate in specific languages (such as to people in specific countries where that language is the primary language in use) you can target such language-specific policies to those populations to make the solution more accurate. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>At this moment, Communication compliance gathers and analyzes messages on a 24-hour cycle, which starts at the moment a policy is enabled for the first time. You may want to plan the creation of policies that relate to time-sensitive matters (such as threats) so it completes at the same time when you expect your analysts to check daily for alerts, in order to minimize the delay in reviewing messages. For other types of policies some organizations prefer to align their creation with the end of the productive day for most employees so policies can be reviewed before the next day. </p> </li> <li> <p>While compliance alerts are often monitored by individuals specifically assigned to the role, assessment of noncompliance often requires escalation to other roles in the organization. It is recommended that before putting your policies in production you identify the appropriate stakeholders and personas in your organization to collaborate for remediation actions and alerts triaging in communication compliance. Some recommended personas to include in the end-to-end investigation workflow are human resources, compliance/privacy and legal. You may also want to involve people that are fluent in specific languages or that are familiar with the culture of specific regions since there may be local nuances that change the meaning of some phrases. It is often useful to create groups in Office 365 or channels in Teams including these persons to make obtaining feedback about these types of situations more efficient (though for obvious reasons assessment of offensive language or images is typically better handled 1:1). Also, in order to allow these persons to have direct access to the Communication compliance console, assign the required role groups to these groups or individuals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before enabling the solution broadly in your production environment, you may consider testing the policies with a small set of production users or in a test environment while waiting for the necessary privacy and legal reviews in your organization. Bear in mind that evaluating it in a test environment will require that you generate simulated user content to create alerts that can be triaged and processed, so testing with a small group of users in a production environment is usually preferred.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the anonymization feature in settings to pseudonymize display names for risky users to maintain privacy and prevent bias when reviewing alerts and taking appropriate actions within the tool. </p> </li> <li> <p>After creating a new policy, expect alerts to start arriving in 24 hours, though there may be additional delay in some cases. </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dag/ir-cc/#investigating-alerts","title":"Investigating Alerts","text":"<p>The first step to investigate issues detected by your policies is to review generated alerts in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

You also need to consider which decisions are within your control as a company and which are driven by regulatory or industry requirements. It is important to remember that this is a strategy across all your information.  That strategy should define who has the authority to make information related decisions. These individuals will be heavily involved in your retention policy, label taxonomy and file plan discussions.

Read more about it in the \u201cMIP Client Consideration\u201d section.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Natively for macOS, iOS and Android</p> </li> <li> <p>Native labeling vs AIP Client</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Container labeling for SharePoint Sites, Teams and Office 365 Groups</p> <ul> <li> <p>Public vs Private access</p> </li> <li> <p>Unmanaged device access</p> </li> <li> <p>Sharing levels</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>PowerBI Dashboards and PBIX assets</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Use label names for your labels that intuitively resonate with your users. Using company jargon that is well ingrained in the employee\u2019s culture is a valid approach, though care must be taken to ensure the labels are also meaningful to new employees. For example, using acronyms in label names is not ideal due to the opacity to new employees and the difficulty of visually recognizing them. Using short, meaningful words such as \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cSecret\u201d generally works best.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider label order. Labels are sorted from lowest sensitivity to highest sensitivity, which means higher sensitivity labels represent an \u201cupgrade\u201d in the confidentiality of the information and usually have stronger protection measures. This order can be enforced by preventing users from downgrading sensitivity of a document unless they have the right privileges, and there are multiple scenarios in which it is important that the order of the labels is clear. It is important that the names you use reflect this order, ad you should avoid using terms that have no clear hierarchy. For example, not all users might agree on whether \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cSecret\u201d is the most sensitive label, so using something like \u201cConfidential\u201d vs. \u201cHighly confidential\u201d may be preferable. </p> </li> <li> <p>Use sublabels with intent. Labels are generally used to represent the actual sensitivity of the content that is labeled, while sublabels are typically used to represent variations in the protection or the scope of the content. For example, you might have a label taxonomy that includes \u201cGeneral Business\u201d, \u201cConfidential\u201d and \u201cHighly Confidential\u201d as top-level labels. Sublabels such as \u201cInternal\u201d or \u201cExternal\u201d designate specific types of data in some of those top-level categories that need to be controlled in specific ways. You might also have project/team specific sublabels or sublabels to address special requirements such as excluding the application of content markings for content that should not be modified. </p> </li> <li> <p>Keep it simple with no more than five top level labels and five sublabels. User experience research shows that with five or fewer labels, users can target the desired label directly in a single movement, whereas if there are more elements in the list the user will typically have to read through them each time, making mistakes more likely. The 5x5 approach is proven to keep things simple and help users choose the right labels, but if you can keep labels below those numbers, even better. </p> </li> <li> <p>Define labels that will last a long time. Since labels often become part of a company\u2019s culture and language, it is critical that they are not frequently altered, especially when it comes to the names and meanings of the top-level labels. The approach mentioned in the previous point makes this easy: using top-level labels to represent the sensitivity of the document means they will not change often. Sublabels, on the other hand, can be more dynamic, and while it is preferable to frame them in a way that follows a clear pattern that rarely changes, adding or changing sublabels as additional requirements such as new projects or divisions come up is usually not a problem if you follow a consistent pattern. </p> </li> <li> <p>Do not put sensitive information in a label\u2019s name or description. This might sound obvious, but it is common that IT departments are asked to create a label to protect information for a merger or acquisition or a label for a secret project that is not known to the general population in the company. Putting the name of the company or a word that reveals more about the project than what is public in the name of the label can reveal such data to all users, even if the label is scoped to a small team. While scoped labels are not made available to all users, metadata about the existence of such labels is carried within the policies all users get, so it is important that codenames or other non-disclosing keywords are used in such labels instead. </p> </li> <li> <p>Plan your auto-labeling strategy, MIP provide both Service and Client based auto-labeling for different use cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Service-side auto labeling policies should be used for data at rest in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business and data in transit for Exchange Online when specific SITs need to be detected and labels applied automatically.  This can be especially helpful when the data source is not controlled and might be that data is stored or sent without being labeled by the client solution. Also, it\u2019s a great option to label data that is already stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business.</p> </li> <li> <p>Client-side labeling when users edit documents or compose (also reply or forward) emails: Use a label that is configured for auto-labeling for files and emails (includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook). This method supports recommending a label to a user, as well as automatically applying a label. But in both cases, the user decides whether to accept or reject the label, to help ensure the correct labeling of content. This client-side labeling has minimal delay for documents because the label can be applied even before the document is saved. However, not all client apps support auto-labeling. This capability is supported by the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, and some versions of Office.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If your organization operates in multiple languages, work with your localization teams to ensure the names chosen for the labels can be easily localized and are meaningful in all the required languages. Consider words that have a clear meaning in one language might be harder to localize or be ambiguous when translated. Examples of such words are \u201cPublic\u201d which can have nuanced meanings in some languages, and \u201cPersonal\u201d which can be easily confused in meaning to refer to private information. </p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the impact on usability. Forcing users to select labels too frequently can lead to users doing it reflexively without thinking about the label they should apply. Using a predefined default label is good practice in scenarios where manually labeling everything could be a burden - and where there is some \u201csafe\u201d sensitivity level that applies to most content. One such case is email, where for most users in most organizations labeling emails as \u201cInternal\u201d by default should be a safe option and reduce user effort considerably. Users can label emails as \u201cexternal\u201d, \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d as needed. At the same time, most users do not create dozens of new documents per day, so asking them to individually label each document without providing a default is an acceptable requirement in most cases. MIP allows you to do this by using a different default label for emails and documents using the advanced option named \u201cOutlookDefaultLabel\u201d that specifies a default label for Outlook independently from what is set for documents. </p> </li> <li> <p>Compartmentalize data sparingly. Compartmentalization of data is essential in many businesses and using scoped sublabels that are shown and give rights to people in specific departments is a good practice, but you should use this capability in moderation. If you have a dozen critical projects that need to contain their data from being accessed by the general population of employees, creating sublabels specifically for them is beneficial. But if you have a thousand projects that demand the same treatment, the administrative burden imposed by such label taxonomy would be large and you will likely end up hitting a practical limit. The best practice is to define a clear rule for which kinds of teams, projects, divisions, or groups get their own sublabels which ensures only a small number of sublabels need to be created (a few dozen) - and stick with it. </p> </li> <li> <p>Consider what threats you are trying to prevent \u2013 not what users will be doing with the content. When defining protection policies some organizations start by thinking about what users need to do with their content, and define rights based on that. That often leads to frustration, since IT will rarely know everything every employee needs to do with the content. It can also lead to more protection than is necessary, and since there is a small overhead (for the computers and the humans) involved whenever accessing something is protected via encryption and rights enforcement, that is undesirable. Start instead with what threats you are trying to prevent: you might want to prevent your competitors from accessing your confidential plans, or from users accidentally putting sensitive data where unauthorized people can view it. Based on those requirements, define the minimal controls that must be there to ensure those scenarios do not happen and implement them. With time, as you gain more confidence on understanding what users need to do, you can adjust settings to implement tighter restrictions as needed. </p> </li> <li> <p>Involve different teams in the review of your proposed label taxonomy, including compliance, legal, public relations, end user education, etc. Defining labels is not an IT security task alone, and their early feedback will help you define a label taxonomy that will work for a long time and not need to be revised after deployment when those teams observe the labels you defined do not meet their needs or address their scenarios.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dag/mip-dlp/#deployment-test-plan","title":"Deployment Test Plan","text":"<ul> <li> <p>For the labeling client experience, consider your deployment methodology for Windows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Native labeling use Monthly Enterprise Channel or Monthly Channel for updates to Office 365 ProPlus.

Conduct a practical validation to see how accurate your users are at using these labels. One option is to create an email with fake sensitive information in the form of documents attached and send it to a subset of users asking them to open each document in turn and label it. They do not even need to report the results, since you will be able to see how they labeled each document in the Activity Explorer in the compliance center. You can alternatively do an offline activity, by setting baskets in the office\u2019s entrance, printing copies of a mix of pretend sensitive documents, and putting them in a pile at the entrance with a sign that says, \u201ctake one and put it in the corresponding basket\u201d. Users usually do this exercise consciously and it allows you to get a very representative idea of how well your users understand policies and labeling taxonomy. After you have done an exercise, you can validate the accuracy of user\u2019s actions and tune your labels and training materials accordingly. </p> </li> <li> <p>Socialize labels so they become part of the organization\u2019s natural language. While experience indicates the sensitivity label UI is simple enough that users do not need to be trained in its use, it is important to perform an awareness campaign in which the meaning of the different labels and the important of their use is highlighted (i.e., awareness emails, physical posters, etc.). The objective of such a campaign is that users incorporate the organization\u2019s labels as part of their natural language and that can intuitively assign documents to their corresponding label.

For more details on container labels please review the document here. </p> <p>When you create a sensitivity label, you can automatically assign that label to files and emails when it matches conditions that you specify.</p> <p>This ability to apply sensitivity labels to content automatically is important because:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You don't need to train your users when to use each of your classifications.</p> </li> <li> <p>You don't need to rely on users to classify all content correctly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Users no longer need to know about your policies\u2014they can instead focus on their work.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are two different methods for automatically applying a sensitivity label to content in Microsoft 365:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Client-side labeling when users edit documents or compose (also reply or forward) emails: Use a label that's configured for auto-labeling for files and emails (includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook).</p> <ul> <li> <p>Supports recommending a label to users or automatically applying a label.</p> </li> <li> <p>User decides whether to accept or reject the label, to help ensure the correct labeling of content.</p> </li> <li> <p>Minimal delay for documents because the label can be applied even before the document is saved.</p> </li> <li> <p>Not all client apps support auto-labeling.

When there is a match, the email is labelled but not the attachment.</p> </li> <li> <p>For more details on this including what file types are supported please review the information here. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have Exchange transport rules (ETRs) or data loss prevention (DLP) policies that apply Information Rights Management (IRM) encryption: When content is identified by these rules or policies and an auto-labelling policy, the label is applied. If that label applies encryption, the Information Rights Management settings from the Exchange transport rules or DLP policies are ignored. However, if that label doesn't apply encryption, the Information Rights Management settings from the transport rules or DLP policies are applied in addition to the label.</p> </li> <li> <p>Email that has Information Rights Management encryption with no label will be replaced by a label with any encryption settings when there is a match by using auto-labelling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incoming email is labelled when there is a match with your auto-labelling conditions. However, if the label is configured for encryption, that encryption is not applied.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the label applies encryption, the Rights Management issuer and Rights Management owner is the person who sends the email.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>With these limitations in mind, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA) can be used to apply labels for these services and several third-party SaaS applications also. MDCA has its own limitations and considerations which are discussed in this blog post.</p> <p>To protect and label structured data you should consider a solution like Azure Purview which among other things can allow you to Classify data using built-in and custom classifiers and Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels which allows you to label sensitive data consistently across SQL Server, Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power BI.

For example, you can identify any document containing a credit card number that is stored in any OneDrive for Business site, or you can monitor just the OneDrive sites of specific people.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevent the accidental sharing of sensitive information. For example, you can identify any document or email containing a health record that is shared with people outside your organization, and then automatically block access to that document or block the email from being sent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monitor and protect sensitive information in the desktop versions of Excel, PowerPoint, and Word applications.

You can educate your users about DLP policies and help them remain compliant without blocking their work. For example, if a user tries to share a document containing sensitive information, a DLP policy can both send them an email notification and show them a policy tip in the context of the document library that allows them to override the policy if they have a business justification. The same policy tips also appear in Outlook on the web (OWA), Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word Office clients.</p> </li> <li> <p>View DLP alerts and reports showing content that matches your organization\u2019s DLP policies. To view alerts and metadata related to your DLP policies you can use the DLP Alerts Management Dashboard.

Some recommended personas to include compliance/privacy, security, human resources, and legal. </p> </li> <li> <p>Identify the types of information you need to protect and where this information is stored. Consider using the Data Classification page in the M365 SCC to help with this identification. Are there any types of information that will require the creation of custom Sensitive Information Types to detect? Where is the information stored in terms of workloads? Use the DLP Playbook to answer these questions and more. Currently, DLP supports the following workloads for protection:</p> <ul> <li>Exchange Online</li> <li>SharePoint Online</li> <li>OneDrive for Business</li> <li>Microsoft Teams</li> <li>Devices</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (acting as a proxy for creation of MDCA policy within the tenant</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Currently only global full or view only permissions are available for alerts at this time and cannot be further carved into areas of responsibility based on such as departments, locations etc. All designs should take this limitation into account before deployment is undertaken. If this capability is an absolute requirement, consider establishing a feed of all DLP alerts and activities into Azure Sentinel and configuring access rights accordingly within the solution..</p> </li> <li> <p>Existing Exchange Online mail flow and DLP rules created in the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) will need to be gradually migrated to the M365 SCC, but will continue to function together with new policies created in the M365 SCC as documented here. Consider creating equivalent rules and disabling old rules in EAC while testing your new ones, then deleting the old rules when no longer needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the presence of Sensitivity labels as a condition in your DLP policy should be closely considered as a standard in your organization.   A sensitivity label is more likely to represent security sensitive information than a simple pattern match from a SIT, especially if you are using manual or recommended labeling, as the data is likely to have been deliberately classified by and end user as a match for certain sensitive information.   Additionally, labels applied automatically via a trainable classifier are far more likely to be accurately classified than from pattern matching.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dag/mip-dlp/#deployment-test-plan_1","title":"Deployment Test Plan","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Always create DLP policies initially in test mode as this gives you an opportunity to determine not only if the policy is alerting correctly via email (nothing will flow through to the DLP reports in audit mode by design) but this will also allow you to determine if the thresholds you have configured for each rule are appropriate. For example, suppose you have configured your rule to trigger when more than 5 credit card numbers have detected. During testing you realize that it would be more appropriate to trigger the rule on 1 credit card number, so you edit the rule to make this change and then enable the policy to allow for the population of alerts in the reports.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the DLP policy templates initially to see whether they make sense for your organization.   These templates are preconfigured with certain Sensitive Information Types to monitor based on the regulatory compliance frameworks you need to monitor broken down by vertical organization type and country. This can drastically reduce the amount of time needed to create and test policies during your deployment test.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your licensing plan allows, consider using alerts based on volume thresholds rather than sending alerts each time a rule is matched. This allows for more targeted alert behavior based on when certain thresholds are exceeded or when the number of activities are above a certain number, which is more likely to be representative of suspicious behavior and leads to fewer alerts being ignored as \u201cnoise\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>When creating DLP policies, consider separate policies per workload. For example, you might have a policy named \u201cPCI-DSS-ExchangeOnline\u201d and one named \u201cPCI-DSS-SharePointOnline\u201d.   The reason for this is that when combining workloads, the DLP rules interface will only show conditions common to each workload chosen, which can lead to many options missing when incompatibilities occur. Consider a case where a policy is choosing Exchange Online and SharePoint Online as workloads. The below figures show the DLP Rules Wizard conditions when the policy chooses Exchange Online in isolation versus in conjunction with SharePoint Online.</p> </li> </ul> Figure 2: Policy Wizard with single workload for Exchange Online Figure 3: Policy Wizard with multiple workloads <ul> <li> <p>When adding files to SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, there is an expected lag time between when the file is added and indexing occurs, a necessary process that must complete before DLP policies can be enforced. For more on how this works use this link. This leads to an opportunity for data leakage while waiting for this process to occur. Consider configuring SharePoint sensitive by default functionality to ensure this does not become an issue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure that you have fully documented your policies and their expected outcomes for end users as part of your user acceptance and training procedures.   Not all aspects of the user experience are identical across all platforms and this should be considered so as not to generate unnecessary help desk calls.  A good example of this is policy tips and their behavior across the various OS platforms.  You should expect to see Policy Tips in Office Online and Windows, but not macOS for instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure you have a well-documented and functional test plan, with clear tasks and outcomes.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dag/mip-dlp/#production-deployment_1","title":"Production Deployment","text":"<ul> <li> <p>DLP reports should be scheduled and emailed to appropriate stakeholders based on the report types (schedules and recipients can be defined directly from the report itself in the Security and Compliance report viewer at https://protection.office.com).

MIP labels are highly synergistic with traditional DLP. The biggest challenge with DLP is handling incidents such as false positives and exceptions, which generally disrupt user work and often require reactive actions taken by IT to unblock productivity and labels can help with that. For example, you can define a DLP rule that blocks Personally identifiable information (PII) from being shared outside of the organization, but make an exception for low-count PII (e.g., &lt;2 credit card numbers) if the content is labeled as \u201cNon-business\u201d to allow for employees to share their personal information with family members when needed, and also exempt moderate counts of PII (e.g. &lt;10 credit card numbers) if it is in protected form. You can even create a blanket exception for a label such as \u201cExecutive Sharing Exception\u201d which bypasses all DLP filters, but that is only available to specific people that are trusted to deal with this information, and that they must explicitly choose for the sensitive content they need to share. Use of such labels can be closely monitored and reported. </p> </li> <li> <p>When you are setting up a policy for Teams as a workload you should consider combining this with SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business to maintain complete coverage.

Prior to Exchange 2010, if an item was soft deleted by a user, it was stored in what was called the \"dumpster\", which would then purge items as they reached the database's configured retention time.  The major limitation with the dumpster concept, however, was that if a mailbox was moved \u2013 all the items in the dumpster were lost.

Since the alternative for the default label is to use one without protection, they see no good alternative. Including DLP in the design means you can set a label without encryption but still with \u201cprotection\u201d. E.g., you can have Confidential and HC labels using encryption, and public/personal without encryption, but the default label can be \u201cInternal\u201d enforced to stay that way by DLP, preventing accidental sharing and forwarding unless the user explicitly selects another label (e.g., External).

After some escalation they convince you to grant them an exception, which now must be encoded in the DLP rule. With each such exception the DLP rule becomes more complicated and less legible, increasing risk of mistakes. And then one day one of these users accidentally forwards an email full of PII to a random person and all your DLP work was for nothing. With labels added to DLP rules you can have a \u201cPII Special Sharing Exception\u201d label, which is exempted from the DLP rule up to a certain amount of PII. In the same situation instead of complicating the DLP rules with each exception you add one exception to the policy for that label, and then you add the group in question to the scope of the label. This is easier to manage and more scalable, and it also means that accidents like the one above won\u2019t happen since the user has to select the label explicitly and proactively when they need to share such content with such partners.

Sensitive Information Types are pattern-based classifiers which detect sensitive information like social security, credit card or bank account numbers within a tenant, and help customers to identify, evaluate, and protect their data. Data Classification Service and specifically Sensitive Information Types allow customers to define and identify what information is considered sensitive in their environments.

Labels once applied to documents and email become the basis for enforcing data protection policies throughout the tenants\u2019 digital estate. When a label is applied to a file or email it is persisted as document metadata. When a label is applied to a SharePoint site or OneDrive for business the label persists as container metadata.</p>"},{"location":"playbooks/service-side-auto-labeling/#auto-labeling-overview","title":"Auto-Labeling Overview","text":"<p>There are multiple methods for automatically applying a label to emails and documents based on their content in Microsoft 365, two of the key ones are:</p> <p>Default SharePoint document library labels: When SharePoint is enabled for sensitivity labels, you can configure a default label for document libraries. Then, any new files uploaded to that library, or existing files edited in the library will have that label applied if they don't already have a sensitivity label, or they have a sensitivity label but with lower priority.</p> <p>Label API: Label API is a pay per use API that can label up to 75k files a day. It can be used to override manual labeled files.</p> <p>Client-side auto-labeling: Client-side auto-labeling happens on the client workstation as the user creates or edits a document or email using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Office web applications (OWA). Depending on the content detected, the label is applied automatically or recommended to the users based on the properties of the label. A default label can also be assigned to documents and emails. This form of client-side labeling does not evaluate document content based on conditions defined on a global policy, but it is based on properties defined for each label.</p> <p>Service-side auto-labeling: Service-side auto-labeling is sometimes referred to as auto-labeling for data at rest and data in transit. Unlike client-side auto-labeling, service side auto labeling does not depend on the client to analyze the document content while it is being created. Instead, service-side auto-labeling reviews content that is stored (at-rest) in SharePoint or OneDrive document libraries, or that is \"in-flight\" or being sent within Exchange. For instance, when a message is submitted to transport. All policy review and application are done within the service. Service-side auto-labeling policies are created and configured from the Information Protection section of the Compliance Center under the Auto-labeling policy tab. Auto-labeling policies don't support recommended labeling because the user doesn't interact with the labeling process. Instead, the administrator runs the policies in simulation mode to help ensure the correct labeling of content before applying the label. </p> <p>Comparison of auto-labeling solutions: The table below provides a comparison of Service-side, Client-side, and Defender for cloud apps auto-labeling solutions that can help you identify when a particular solution is appropriate for labeling needs.</p> Capabilities Service side Client side Defender for cloud apps (MCAS) Application support SharePoint, OneDrive and Exchange Online Word, PowerPoint, Excel or Outlook Microsoft 365 apps, or AIP plugin for Office SharePoint, OneDrive and third-party services supported by Defender for cloud apps File types supported .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and related formats .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and related formats .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and related formats, PDF Policy scoping By site, group or user, admin units By label By service, site, folder Classification options Standard Sensitive Info Types; Custom Sensitive Info Types (incl. dictionaries); Exact Data Matching Trainable classifiers (in private preview) Standard Sensitive Info Types; Custom Sensitive Info Types (incl. dictionaries); Exact Data Matching; Trainable Classifiers Standard Sensitive Info Types; Custom Sensitive Info Types (incl. dictionaries); Exact Data Matching; Trainable Classifiers; Fingerprint; Regular Expression Labeling conditions Sensitive content; Content is shared; Recipient properties; Sender properties; Email subject; Document title; Attachment extension; Attachment can't be scanned; Attachment is encrypted; Email headers Sensitive content in document or email body; Sensitive content in attachment Sensitive content; Access level; App;  Content is shared; Creation time; File ID; File type; File owner; MIME type; Parent folder; Quarantine status; Existing sensitivity label; Document title; File extension Interaction with users Label visible after user opens document Automatic labeling: user can override; Recommended label: user can accept or dismiss Label visible after user opens document.

What is sensitive in your organization? Start with our sensitive information types. We have 200+ out of the box sensitive information types that we help detect in your organization. Check content explorer to see which sensitive information types we are finding. </p> <p>So, what information is there? Do you detect a lot of sensitive information that needs to be protected with labeling?</p> <p>If you are unsure of what data to protect or how to get started, look at our provided Financial, Medical and Health, and Privacy templates. These provide a great baseline of sensitive information types to protect given different regulations and industries. You can customize these templates to add more sensitive information types you are concerned with.</p> <p>Named entities recognition (NER) allows you to be able to identify entities like physical address, names, and more with other sensitive information types to be more confident that it is something you are looking for. This works great to reduce false positives.</p> <p>As you get more advanced or have more business use cases, you can also explore things like exact data matching which looks at your specific customer data that you are passing in detects and labels for this customer's information. This is a more complex process that requires more time to configure and execute but can bring your false positive rates to near zero allowing you to be more assertive with auto-labeling policies. </p> <p>Another option is trainable classifiers where we use machine learning, to understand what content in your organization looks like from business files like resumes to source code and protect that information.</p> <p>These different classifier types are not mutually exclusive to each other. You can and in fact we encourage you to try out combinations of different types of classifiers. For example, you can use a sensitive information type (SIT) for PII together with named entity recognition for person's names in a policy trying to detect large amounts of identity information in a table, or you can use trainable classifiers together with a custom SIT to detect invoices above a certain amount. You can also use EDM as an exclusion to a rule based on a regular SIT to avoid identifying employee PII as potential customer PII, etc.</p> <p>Our advanced classifiers allow you to protect found credentials in files and intellectual property and other important business documents with trainable classifiers. </p> <p>In addition</p> <ol> <li> <p>Pick your scope:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Option 1: ALL \u2013 SharePoint sites, OneDrive users/groups and Email users</p> </li> <li> <p>Option 2: Subset of sites or accounts \u2013 can use PowerShell for longer lists</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Select a label to use for auto-labeling, but note:</p> <ul> <li> <p>This label will not go into effect until you turn on your policy from simulation mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can always simulate the policy.
